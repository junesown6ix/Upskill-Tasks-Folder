    <p>
      Hello, I am Daniel, an aspiring passionate software developer, hoping to
      harness a creative flair for crafting engaging and dynamic digital
      experiences. <br />My journey into the world of coding started with the
      curiosity to bring ideas to life, and also, frankly speaking, to be able
      to land a big role one day, <br />and hopefully, a remote one, because I
      hate the outside world.
    </p>
    <br />
    <p>
      Started out on this path as a self learner, which proved to be a little
      challenging more often than not, but those challenges I thrived on,
      <br />but at the same time I knew that something was missing. It was the
      need to belong to a community. That nagging feeling brought me to the door
      steps of Upskill, <br />which makes it possible to be a part of a
      community, connect with people with a shared interest and also a common
      goal of becoming competent software developers.
    </p>
    <br />
    <p>
      The journey so far in this current Upskill cohort has been nothing short
      of fun, as I have been able to connect with prospective learners like
      myself,
      <br />and also engage with people who are at different stages of their web
      development careers. We share ideas, discuss problems and aslo potential
      solutions. <br />Seeing as we just got started with classes, it is not
      surprising that things have been fairly basic, which is great, as there
      are many newbies involved. <br />But I look forward to more complicating
      stuff and challenging tasks. By the end of this program I hope that I will
      come out of it much better than I was when I started.
